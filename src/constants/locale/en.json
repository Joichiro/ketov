      "In the outside world, express almost certainly means more expensive. You pay for speed. In design, it’s quite the opossite. It’s normal to pay a lot for something taking a lot of time, estimated for zilions hours. For some reason, it’s normal to pay for more hours, but not for higher hourly rate and less hours. So designers are exaggerating the timesheet, catching up their low rates.",
      "By the same logic, if you are too experienced, so you can work really fast, you should normally get paid less – for less hours spend. That’s why I said no to this crap and created the One day, for which you’ll pay like for a normal week project, but I won’t bullshit you and get it done in 10 hours of work time the same day."
